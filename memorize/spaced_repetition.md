# Spaced Repetition software

on iOS I use an app called "CleverDeck"

I've even put sight-words and dolce-words in there for my youngest child to learn from (she's learning to read)

Another child has a copy of clever deck she used for finally solidifying her knowledge of the "times tables" she couldn't quite get clear in her mind. 7*8, 11*12, and a few like that.

With clever deck you can quickly add your own cards.

A single fact may be best represented by more than 3 cards:

 - word &#x21B7; definition
 - definition &#x21B7; word
 - example with word missing &#x21B7; example with word filled in. (note: this is called cloze deletion)

## Topics to gather

 - Basic strategy for 21
 - Birthdays of people I know
 - Children's (and pet's) names of friends
 - Bash commands
 - Ubuntu paths
 - Guitar chords
 - Guitar scales
 - git commands
 - interesting words
 - words I commonly misspell
 - Mental Models"

# All Models are Wrong, Some Models are Useful

The saying

> All models are wrong, some are useful

...is from British statistician, George Box

What does it mean?


When you set out to "model" or "simulate" some system or process in the real world, your model will start off as a drastic oversimplification of the thing you are modelling.

Then you may refine the model and it may be a little more similar to the thing you are modelling.

Stop right there.

The goal of modelling is to get useful results. It is not to make a perfect recreation of the thing that is being modelled.

If you attempt to make a perfect model, you will never achieve it. You could spend your life trying to make a "perfect" model of the interactions between the atoms within a single grain of sand.

Only two things are certain about your modelling effort:

1. You will die before you correct the errors in the model
2. That is all we know.


So the goal must never be to make a perfect "thing" -- but rather to stop when the thing is useful, usable. Ideally we stop before we reach "the point of diminishing returns." If we find we have blown right past the point of diminishing returns, then stop right now.


## Extrapolating the rule everywhere

The rule doesn't just apply to a statistician's attempt at modelling a process. I'm happy to extend it to every other domain of life...

e.g.

- All maps are wrong, some are useful
- All models are wrong, some are useful
- All recipes are wrong, some are useful
- All religions are wrong, some are useful
- All guitar tabs are wrong, some are useful
- All observations are wrong, some are useful
- All measurements are wrong, some are useful
- All maths lessons are wrong, some are useful
- All building plans are wrong, some are useful
- All physics theories are wrong, some are useful
- All economic theories are wrong, some are useful
- All political parties are wrong, some are useful
- All weather forecasts are wrong, some are useful
- All articles you read at TIL.secretGeek.net are wrong, some are useful

## A Question


All models are wrong -- some are useful.

But who owns the models? Who chooses the models? Who filters the models?

The question is:

> If all models are wrong, but some are useful, who are they useful for?

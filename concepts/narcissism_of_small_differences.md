# Narcissism of small differences

> it is precisely communities with adjoining territories and close relationships that engage in constant feuds and mutual ridicule because of hypersensitivity to details of differentiation

For example, because Java and C# are so similar, their users are more likely to feud, not less.

At a smaller scale: tabs and spaces make no difference to a running program, so proponents of each are the most likely to feud.

Same for brace positioning.

People pour effort into these things because they are a way of asserting their identity (either group identity or individual identity).

(Research shows me that [Raganwald spotted this in 2008](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/05/narcissism-of-small-code-differences.html) ([discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6710668)))

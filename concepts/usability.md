# Usability: little tips

This could include graphic design and user interface and user experience tips. I'll let it be a grab-bag of ideas. Basically these are [little big details](http://littlebigdetails.com/) ;)

- A "help me decide" link I saw in visual studio just now was a) a good idea and b) good wording!
- Don't go [completely black](https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/) or completely white
- Design Guidelines: [7 practical tips for cheating at design](https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886) -- and as [twitter thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/moments/994601867987619840)
- When using a gradient of color in a graph/chart/map -- don't use a full rainbow. It's confusing, interpreted differently by most pairs of eyes, and the luminescence is particularly not monotonically increasing or decreasing. see [Rainbox Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful](https://github.com/djoshea/matlab-utils/blob/master/libs/perceptuallyImprovedColormaps/Rainbow%20Color%20Map%20-Still-%20Considered%20Harmful.pdf)

# Side Hustle - Chris Guillebeau



Everyone should/can have a side hustle. Gives you more security (i'd add confidence and economic common sense)



Keep your day job.



There's no rules: Product or service, scalable or not. No cost or low cost.



A good idea must be:Feasible profitable and persuasive.



Hustle is Service or product

Product is tangible or intangible



Starter ideas versus NLIs: Next Level Ideas:  NLIs are ones that are scalable beyond your normal labor and or where the customers/goods are replenished





Five qualities to measure when ranking and comparing ideas:

1. Feasible (possible to even do it, low cost)
2. Profit potential (clear path to profit)
3. Persuasive (are people compelled)
4. Efficiency (can it be done quickly)
5. Motivated  (how interested are you)




Idea checklist

1. can you describe in one sentence
2. is there an obvious way to make money?
3. Does it solve a problem for someone?
4. Can you make it happen quickly?
5. Low maintenance?
6. Can you get paid more than once?

# Lean Startup - Eric Ries



Build measure learn loop



Validated learning is what you're building



Identify your leap of faith assumptions

Turn these into hypotheses

Test them



Innovation accounting



Steer



Pivot - sharp change of direction with one foot planted firmly on the ground





Do customers recognize they have the problem?



"Get out of the building."

"Go and see for yourself"

Genchi genbutsu

Also: "get your boots on"



MVP tests one hypothesis



Metrics - not vanity metrics



Metrics based on people not hits



Metrics that can be tied back to a cause



Continuous deployment



Surprising power of small batches

Single piece flow



Build measure learn really starts with "work out what we need to learn" then build something that will create that lesson, measure the customer response, learn from the measurements... and repeat

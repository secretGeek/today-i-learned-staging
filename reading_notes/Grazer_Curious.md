# A curious mind Brian Grazer

Curiosity conversations with interesting people.


"Make the hardest call first": Eliminates the low grade anxiety. Builds confidence.

Interesting about when not to use curiosity. Sometimes he doesn't ask questions. When he pitches a movie he's already decided on and they say no he makes sure it's a no.  But he doesn't ask for or want their feedback. He's already made a taste decision that he likes the idea of this movie and doesn't need their two-penny thoughts on how it could be tweaked.

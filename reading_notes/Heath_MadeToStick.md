# Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath

1. Simple (core) (simple and profound, proverb like) the commander's intent. The lede. Compact.
2. Unexpected- surprising interesting violate expectation counter-intuitive make people curios
3. Concreteness - not abstract, specific, may use concrete metaphors/examples
4. Credible - can test for yourself, backed with guarantees, authority
5. Emotions - people must care. An individual over a statistic. Many emotions to choose from: fear resentment compassion disgust
6. Stories.

2 step plan.

Step 1: find the core.
Step 2: Translate the core using the success checklist.

## Core--

Illustrate the core by saying how it beats adjacent priorities. Eg if you've found the best chicken salad in the world I don't care about it if it interferes with our need to be the best low cost airline.

## Commander's Intent

Commander's intent was a great example i learned from this book.

The commander has to not only tell people what to do - but summarize the why -- so that when the what goes pear shapeed they can still improvise on achieving the commander's intent.

When you know the commander's intent - you can answer a lot of questions you haven't faced before, without having to ask the boss.

Here's a quote re south west airlines.

	I can teach you the secret to running this airline in 30 seconds. This is it: We are **THE** low-fare airline. Once you understand that fact, you can make *any* decision about this company's future as well as I can.

	Tracey, from marketing, comes into your office. She says her surveys indicate that the passengers might enjoy a light entree on the Houston to Las Vegas flight. All we offer is peanuts, and she thinks a nice chicken Caesar salad would be popular. 'What do you say?'

	You say "Tracey, will adding the chicken Caesar salad make us THE low-fare airline from Houston to Las Vegas? Because if it *doesn't* help us become **the** unchallenged low-fare airline, we're *not* serving any damn chicken salad".

-- and apparently Dan and CHip got the quote above from "Buck Up, Suck Up, and Come Back When You Foul Up: 12 Winning Secrets from the War Room, James Carville and Paul Begal"

-- and i found it written down for me already in this medium article: [The Commander's Intent: How to Make New Habits Stick](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/commanders-intent/)

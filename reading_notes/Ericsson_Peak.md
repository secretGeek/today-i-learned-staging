# Peak - Anders Ericsson

"Purposeful practice In a nutshell: Get outside your comfort zone but do it in a focused way, with clear goals, a plan for reaching those goals, and a way to monitor your progress. Oh, and figure out a way to maintain your motivation."

"Generally speaking, meaningful positive feedback is one of the crucial factors in maintaining motivation."

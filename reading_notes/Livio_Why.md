# Why? Mario Livio


* Epistemic curiosity is the type Einstein had in abundance
* Specific curiosity - when u want to know what film that actress was in
* Diversive curiosity - restless desire to explore.   Seeking of novel stimulation to avoid boredom. Checking for new email. Impatient etc.
* Empathic curiosity - trying to understand a person as in citizen Kane plot
* Morbid curiosity - can't look away

## Details about Leonardo

He started many more projects than he finished

He was not well read (thankfully! As his experiments were not thus hampered by too many wrong ideas.)

He started by using science to improve his art but finally used art to improve his science.



"Cyberchondria" "a diagnosis based on apparent symptoms that is induced by an internet search"


Novelty can be mapped on these axes:



Specific <---> diversive

> A specific thing that once found will satisfy the seeking, or
>
> Diversive: the ceaseless seeking to ward off boredom



Perceptual <---> epistemic

> Perceptual is aroused by surprising novel or ambiguous
>
> Epistemic is the genuine yearning for new knowledge



Wait - isn't there arousal toward stimulation and secondly satisfaction of the arousal - and you may need to classify it based on both ends of the curiosity arc



Four factors that lead to things being worthy of curiosity:



* Novelty
* Complexity
* Uncertainty and
* Conflict





Curiosity is a cognitive induced deprivation- an information gap



Eg in sudoku we have a clear information gap - small enough that we can fill it and we must fill it



Having filled it a new gap is thus made smaller and within reach - or we believe it is and then we must fill that - and so on.



(Could We model the size of the information gaps at each stage of a game of sudoku, and work out if or when it is maximally satisfying - when are people least likely to lose interest? - and from this develop genetic algorithms that evolve novel games with maximally enjoyable rulesets? Again modeling the human brain in some rudimentary way is an obvious need of such systems. A definition of fun. )

# Atomic Habits, James Clear



## Trigger Loop

The trigger loop (according to James) is

* Trigger
* Craving
* Action
* Reward


As the habit is reinforced, the loop repeated, the craving part goes from non-existent to very strong. At first, the dopamine peak is at the 'reward' step. Once the habit has kicked in, we get the dopamine hit as a much bigger peak at the 'craving' step. It's anticipatory.

The craving is what motivates us.


## Lagging Measure


> You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.

> Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

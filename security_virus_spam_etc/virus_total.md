# Is your product being flagged as a virus/malware

If anyone is reporting that your product is a virus, then virus total will know about it

One company was flagging NimbleText as a virus. I found out who via Virus Total.

I emailed them (the problem company, not virus total) and they corrected the issue within a day.

Here's a page that lists how to contact a large number of Antivirus vendors:

[How to Report False Positives to Antivirus Vendors](http://www.virus-removal-help.com/how-to-report-false-positives-to-antivirus-vendors/)

"Rising" was particularly hard to track down. I found this page: http://mailcenter.rising.com.cn/filecheck_en/


If your webpage is flagged as containing malware that's a different problem. See Google Search Console tip.

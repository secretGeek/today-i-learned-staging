# Is your website flagged as containing malware?


google search console (formerly google webmaster tools) tells you if there's any spam/malware on your sites.

for example i received this warning:

    Hacked content detected on http://timesnapper.com/

...found the problem, found the cause, fixed it, wrote to google and they stopped penalizing my site.

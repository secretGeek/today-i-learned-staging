# Virtual Box requires Hyper-V to be disabled

In virtualbox if you only have options to create 32 bit VMs... Why is that!?

It's because virtual box requires that Hyper-V be disabled.

Now I'm checking: if i disable Hyper-V can I re-enable it later?

	dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V

	dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V /All

You need to be running 64-bit powershell, elevated.

If you're not elevated, you'll get:

	> dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V

	Error: 740

	Elevated permissions are required to run DISM.
	Use an elevated command prompt to complete these tasks.

...so elevate.

And if you're not running 64-bit powershell, you'll get:

	> dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V

	Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
	Version: 10.0.10586.0

	Error: 11

	You cannot service a running 64-bit operating system with a 32-bit version of DISM.
	Please use the version of DISM that corresponds to your computer's architecture.

	The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log

So run from an elevated 64-bit version of Powershell.

	> dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V

	Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
	Version: 10.0.10586.0

	Image Version: 10.0.10586.0

	Disabling feature(s)
	[==========================100.0%==========================]
	The operation completed successfully.
	Restart Windows to complete this operation.
	Do you want to restart the computer now? (Y/N)

Restart the computer.

Now when you open Virtual Box there's a bunch of 64 bit machines you can create.

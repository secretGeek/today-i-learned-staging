# Resolved: There was an error downloading the plugin list

I decided to try once again to use the plugin manager to get the [TextFX Characters plugin](install_textfx_plugin.md).

Ran Plugin Manager... it needed to be updated.

After the update:

1. It has ads: "Plugin list hosting generously provided by" (some business I'd like to DDOS)

And message:

> There was an error downloading the plugin list. Please check your internet connection, and your proxy settings in Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome.

So we went backwards.

I changed the setting that says "Force HTTP instead of HTTPS for downloading Plugin List". Restarted Notepad++ and was then able to download the plugin list and install the TextFX Characters plugin.

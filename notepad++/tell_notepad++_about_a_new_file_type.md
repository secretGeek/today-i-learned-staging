# Telling NotePad++ About a New File Type

(example, adding .config as xml)

 * Go to Settings > Style Configurator...
 * Under Language, scroll down and highlight "XML"
 * Beneath the Language list, find User ext. textbox and add "config" to the list. (That textbox contains a space-delimited list of extensions. Do not include the dot (e.g. "xml config" not ".xml .config")
 * Press Save & Close
 * You will need to close and reopen the file, for the syntax highlighting to take effect.

# Bluetooth Windows Problem with TCL Television

There is a tcl television near a particular Windows 10 Computer, as of Thursday, the 31 December 2020, 7:53 PM. 

In `Settings > Bluetooth and other devices` the television is listed there, with the name we gave it -- a 3 letter long name. Let's alias this as TIP.

TIP is listed over and over again, an endless number of times.

Deleting a single instance of this is very tedious. You have to click one of the `TIP` labels to give it focus, at which time a `Remove device` button first becomes visible. You click that a grey curtain of death descends from the sky and clouds every step you take until it clears. There is a smell of burning sulphur and distant flickers of fire. A bolt of lightning falls from the sky and pops a handful of balloons above your eyes. Once you confirm that you really would like to get rid of the device, it dissappears and only a thousand or more remain.

Where are these listed?

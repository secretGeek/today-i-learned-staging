# Host a gitbook on a custom subdomain

(Previously this site (<https://TIL.secretGeek.net>) was hosted by gitbook, but now I use github pages and my own [.net core static site generator, clown car](https://github.com/secretGeek/clowncar))

By default the book is hosted on http://{author}.gitbooks.io/{book}/
and can be read at https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/{author}/{book}

If you want to host it on a custom sub domain then you may need to add a `cname` record at your webhost.

Then, at gitbook.com tell it the custom domain.

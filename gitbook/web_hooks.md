# To have your gitbook updated whenever you push to a github repo

In gitbook, tell it which repository to use:

e.g. in

> https://www.gitbook.com/book/{yourUsername}/{yourBookName}/settings/github

Tell it your github repository:

	{yourUserName}/{YourRepo}

And to get the webhooks set up....

- Under "Integration" heading
	- Next to the "Webhook URL" is a "copy to clipboard" button. Click it, to copy your webhook url.

Then click "Check Webhooks" -- this takes you to Github. Specifically it takes you to "Webhooks and Services" for your repo, i.e.

	https://github.com/{yourUserName}/{YourRepo}/settings/hooks

- Under "Webhooks" click "Add webhook"
	- In "Payload URL" paste the "Webhook URL" from above.
	- Content type -- leave as default (application/json)
	- Secret -- leave .
	- Which events -- leave as default (just the push event)

And click "Add Webhook"

Once that is working... when you push your repo... your book will update.

It might take a minute. If you go to your book while it is building, they show you a "building" message.

> Your book is currently being updated, this can take up to a few minutes.

# Is this 64 or 32 bit PowerShell today?

On PowerShell [version](version.md) 4.0 and up:

	[Environment]::Is64BitProcess

More thorough again...

	# Is this a Wow64 powershell host
	function Test-Wow64() {
		return (Test-Win32) -and (test-path env:\PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432)
	}

	# Is this a 64 bit process
	function Test-Win64() {
		return [IntPtr]::size -eq 8
	}

	# Is this a 32 bit process
	function Test-Win32() {
		return [IntPtr]::size -eq 4
	}

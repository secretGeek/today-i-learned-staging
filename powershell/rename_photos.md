# How to rename photos, using EXIF data (with powershell)

You can inspect the EXIF data of a photo by uploading it to here: <http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi>

You can rename a photo, such that its name is based on the _second_ at which it was taken, in a **sortable** manner, with this snippet:

    $null = [reflection.assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.Drawing")
    $pic = New-Object System.Drawing.Bitmap($fileName)

    # via http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6834259/how-can-i-get-programmatic-access-to-the-date-taken-field-of-an-image-or-video
    $bytearr = $pic.GetPropertyItem(36867).Value # Date Taken
    $pic.Dispose() # note... must dispose of the pic, if you wish to be able to rename the file! Otherwise get a fil in use error.

    $string = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString($bytearr)
    $exactDate = [datetime]::ParseExact($string,"yyyy:MM:dd HH:mm:ss`0",$Null)
    $length = (dir $fileName | % length )
    $extensionWithDot = [io.path]::GetExtension($FileName)
    $newName = ("{0:yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss}_{1}_{2}_{3}{4}" -f $exactDate, $device, $location, $length, $extensionWithDot)

    write-host "Creating: $newName"
    rename-item $fileName $newName

...all of which is wrapped up in function called 'RenamePhoto' which is dotted by my `$profile`

Note that you can still have problems caused by timezones!

# Repeat every n seconds forever

Repeat a command, on a loop, so you can monitor a process.

I wanted to repeat this every 5 seconds:

    dir . *.* -recurse | measure | % Count


And used this command to achieve it:

	cls; while ($true) { dir . *.* -recurse | measure | % Count; start-sleep -seconds 5; }



This example will show you the file size, every second (expressed in GB)

    while($true) { dir *wellsrv* | % { $_.Length / 1gb; sleep 1} }

Here's one that shows the current time, the file name and size every 20 seconds


	while($true) { dir outputlog.txt | % {
				"" +  (get-date -f "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") +
				": " + ($_.Name) +
				", " + ($_.Length / 1gb) +
				" GB";
				sleep 30
				}
	}


Here's one that shows how much space is left on the drive...

	while (1) {
		get-psdrive C |
			% {
				"" + "{0:0.00}" -f ($_.Used/1GB) + " used, " +
				"{0:0.00}" -f ($_.Free/1GB)   + " free"
			};
			sleep 3;
	}

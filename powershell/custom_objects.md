# Create custom objects.

Say you have two variables, `$name` and `$count` -- and you want to create a custom object that contains just those two properies....

	$myObject = New-Object psobject -property  @{name = $name; count = $count}

Or say you are in a pipeline, within which `$name` and `$count` become available... you want to pipe out a custom object with those two properties...

	dir *.xml | % {
		$name = $_.FullPath
		$count = $_.Length
		# ^^ just for example

		New-Object psobject -property  @{name = $name; count = $count}

		# ^^ Return our custom object... for the next actor in the pipeline to deal with...

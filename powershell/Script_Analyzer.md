# Use Script Analyzer to Find Style Problems with your Scripts

Script analyzer finds errors and gives warnings about your dodgy scripts.

First you need to install it:

If running as admin:

	Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -force

Otherwise:

	Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -Scope CurrentUser -Force


Then you can either run it against a specific script:

	Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer $profile

or against an entire path... and you can include subfolders by using -recurse

	Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path ($pwd).Path -recurse

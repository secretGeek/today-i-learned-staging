# PsGet Conflicts with PowershellGet

There's a new microsoft thing called PowershellGet which lets you install modules from various places.

There's a different, pre-existing thing called PsGet which is a community provided tool for the same sort of stuff.

They both expose commands called install-module and probably some others that collide.

If you have PsGet, and you want Microsoft's PowershellGet to work you have to remove PsGet.

	> Get-Command Install-Module

	CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
	-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
	Function        Install-Module                                     0.0        PsGet

The first clue I had that this problem was occurring was due to these errors:

	> Install-Module -Name NPMTabCompletion
	Install-Module : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'Name'.

And

	> Install-Module NPMTabCompletion
	Module NPMTabCompletion was not found in central repository

I didn't realise this was a problem, because although PsGet has a 'central repository' (mentioned above) the front page of Powershell Gallery uses those same magic words:

> The PowerShell Gallery is the central repository for PowerShell content

To remove PsGet:

Go to:

	"$home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules"

	(e.g. C:\Users\Agatha\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules)

And *delete* the PsGet folder. (Or move it somewhere far away if that makes you more comfortable)

Now when you type:

	which install-module

Expect to see:

	CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
	-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
	Function        Install-Module                                     1.0.0.1    PowerShellGet

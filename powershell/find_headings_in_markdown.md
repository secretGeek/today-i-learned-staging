# Find headings in markdown

To list the headings from a markdown document

	cat .\20_Find_Your_Product.md | select-string -pattern "^#.*"

(Assuming it's pure markdown, not mixed in html)

And the common alias for `select-string` is `sls`, so for brevity:

	cat .\20_Find_Your_Product.md | sls "^#.*"

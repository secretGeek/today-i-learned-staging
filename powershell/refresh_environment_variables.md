# Refresh environment variables

All these years I've been closing and reopening the powershell console, like a chump, every time the environment variables were changed (for example because I changed the path in a different window)

Turns out, in both `powershell` and `cmd.exe` just call:

    refreshenv

...and all your environment variables will be refreshed.

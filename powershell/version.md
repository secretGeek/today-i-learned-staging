# How can I tell which version of powershell I have?

    $PSVersionTable.PSVersion

(Compared to this DOS classic: `ver`)

So I've added this to my profile:

    function ver() {
         $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
    }

But you might also need to consider whether the:

- [currently running shell is 64 or 32 bit](is_this_64_or_32_bit_powershell_today.md)


and...


- [is powershell running as admin?](is_current_user_admin.md)


Or, if you want to: [check the windows version, I've covered that too](../windows/which_version.md).

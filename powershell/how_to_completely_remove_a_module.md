# How to completely remove a module

If you have a conflict with a module then you may need to remove it from your machine.

The `remove-module` commandlet DOES NOT remove the module from your machine, it only:

    Removes modules from the current session.

In other words it reverses:

- `Import-Module` -- which adds modules to the current session.

It does *not* reverse:

- `Install-Module`  -- (with which a "package provider" downloads and installs a module from a "package source")

You need to find where the module sits (each module is a directly full of files) and delete that folder. (Or move it out of harm's way)

	get-module -listavailable

Shows you where each of the modules are located,

e.g.

    Directory: C:\Users\Agatha\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
    Directory: C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
    Directory: C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
    Directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\Code Owls LLC

...and others.

And the results you see from get-module will depend upon where you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Powershell. And which user.

(A module is a "package" -- a specific type of package which exports a bunch of cmdlets.)

Then delete the files of the module (and the folder it is in, which is named after itself)

# Tree

Tree command is great

    > tree
    C:.
    +---asp.net_MVC
    +---powershell
    +---visual_studio

and to see files:

    tree /f

But I'd love to see a Better Tree.

Surely there is a powershell module someone has built that improves on this greatly - but still provides the tree feel.

# Markdown to PDF

to convert markdown to PDF... I made a tool for that:

* [PDF.NimbleText.com](https://pdf.nimbletext.com)

It lets you choose different themes as well.

The conversion from html to pdf is performed by [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf)

And it uses stylesheets/themes from [https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles](https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles)

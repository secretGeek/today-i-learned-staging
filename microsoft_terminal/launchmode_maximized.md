# Launch Microsoft Terminal Maximized Using the Settings 'launchMode": "maximized"'

To launch Microsoft Terminal in a Maximized windows you can go to the settings (click the drop down arrow next to the new tab plus sign) and edit the settings file (in Visual Studio Code probably)

VS Code will offer some intellisense to help here.

Add a setting that says:

    "launchMode": "maximized",

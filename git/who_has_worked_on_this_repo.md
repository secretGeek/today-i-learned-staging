# Who has worked on this git repo?

The amazingly quick way to get a summary of who has worked on a git repo is with this command:

	git shortlog -s -n

It shows you the name of the contributors, the number of commits, order by most to least commits. It can be misleading, but generally it's going to give you a meaningful summary.

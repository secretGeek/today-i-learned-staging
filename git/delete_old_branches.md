# Delete old branches

When I merge a pull request back into main, I delete the branch on the server

But that doesn't delete it locally.

I end up with a bunch of local branches that need cleaning.

If I switch to such branches I see a message that "the upstream is gone."

	> git checkout feature/1234-weaponise-space
	Switched to branch 'feature/1234-weaponise-space'
	Your branch is based on 'origin/feature/1234-weaponise-space', but the upstream is gone.
		(use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

Yes. The upstream is *gone*. Because when the pull request was completed we chose to delete the branch on the server.

Now it's time to delete the local branch.

## Delete local branch

To delete a local branch.

1. Make sure you want it gone.
2. Delete it...

		Delete Local Branch
		
		To delete the local branch use one of the following:
		
			$ git branch -d branch_name
			$ git branch -D branch_name
		
		Note: The `-d` option is an alias for `--delete`, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. You could also use `-D`, which is an alias for `--delete --force`, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status."

--Source: man git-branch.

## Find all 'gone' branches to delete:

	> git branch -vv

Lists all branches and has `: gone]` if their remote component has been removed. e.g.

	> git branch -vv

	refactor/cloud-taser-utc-datetime-handling	5da44411 [origin/refactor/cloud-taser-utc-datetime-handling: gone] moon: 5888 cloud-taser Online.

So the real point here is `: gone]` substring referring to the missing origin.

## To delete the origin

(for example, if you forgot to delete it when merging your pull request)

Delete it on the origin....

	git push --delete origin feature/5992-monkey-magnet-current-archive

Then delete it locally (may need to switch out of it first with `git co master`, for example)

	git branch -d feature/5992-monkey-magnet-current-archive

May need to use `-D` to force the delete if there's some discard-worthy change in there.

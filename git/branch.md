# Branching in git

## 1. create a new branch

if: You've started to do some work but haven't committed anything yet.
(or: you're about to start some work) and decide you'd like it to go to a new branch:

It's as easy as this...

	git checkout -b new-branch

The output you hopefully see is:

> Switched to a new branch 'new-branch'

	git push -u origin $name

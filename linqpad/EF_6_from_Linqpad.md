# Play with Entity Framework 6 from Linqpad

In short:

- add a connection

![choose connection](choose_connection.png)

Choose "Use a typed context from your own assembly"

...with "Entity Framework (DbContext V4/V5/V6)"

(Nearby possibilities include: [adding access to Oracle, MySQL, SQLite](connect_to_oracle.md)... i might prefer that. How about interoperable python-based data providers?)

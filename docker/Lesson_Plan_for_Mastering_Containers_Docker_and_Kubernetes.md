# Lesson Plan for Mastering Containers, Docker, and Kubernetes

This lesson plan progresses from understanding basic concepts of containers, up to mastery of docker and kubernetes.

## Phase 1: Understanding Containers

**Goal:** Grasp container fundamentals, benefits, and the role of Docker.

### Phase 1 Topics

1. **What are Containers?**
   - Introduction to containers and virtual machines
   - The role of containers in modern development and deployment
   - Benefits of containers (portability, isolation, efficiency)

2. **Getting Started with Docker:**
   - Installing Docker
   - Basic Docker commands (`docker run`, `docker pull`, `docker images`, `docker ps`, `docker exec`, `docker stop`, etc.)
   - Exploring Docker Hub
   - Understanding Dockerfile and creating your first Docker image
   - Basic Dockerfile structure (FROM, RUN, CMD, COPY, EXPOSE)

3. **Networking and Volumes:**
   - Docker container networking basics
   - Creating and using Docker volumes for persistent storage
   - Linking containers

4. **Hands-On Exercise:**
   - Build a simple web server inside a Docker container (e.g., Nginx or Node.js)
   - Push an image to Docker Hub

### Outcome

You should understand what containers are and be able to create, run, and share containerized applications.

## Phase 2: Docker Deep Dive

**Goal:** Master Docker and its ecosystem for development and production use.

### Phase 2 Topics

1. **Docker Compose:**
   - Introduction to multi-container applications
   - Defining services in `docker-compose.yml`
   - Managing lifecycle (`docker-compose up`, `docker-compose down`)
   - Networking between services in Docker Compose

2. **Dockerfile Optimization:**
   - Best practices for writing Dockerfiles (caching, layer ordering)
   - Multi-stage builds to reduce image size
   - Minimizing attack surface with lightweight base images

3. **Docker Networking:**
   - Bridge network, host network, and overlay network
   - Service discovery and DNS in Docker networks
   - Container communication across multiple hosts

4. **Security in Docker:**
   - Basic security practices (running containers as non-root, using official images)
   - Introduction to Docker Content Trust
   - Scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities (e.g., `docker scan`)

5. **Hands-On Exercise:**
   - Build and orchestrate a multi-container application (e.g., a web app with a database) using Docker Compose
   - Optimize an existing Dockerfile and reduce its size

### Phase 2 Outcome

You should be proficient in using Docker for complex projects and ready to use containers in production environments.

## Phase 3: Introduction to Kubernetes (K8s)

**Goal:** Understand Kubernetes' architecture and basic use cases.

### Phase 3 Topics

1. **Kubernetes Overview:**

   - What is Kubernetes, and why use it?
   - Key concepts: Pods, Nodes, Clusters
   - Kubernetes architecture: Master and worker nodes, etcd, kube-apiserver

2. **Setting Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster:**
   - Installing Minikube or using Docker Desktop with Kubernetes
   - Accessing the Kubernetes dashboard
   - Introduction to `kubectl`

3. **Basic Kubernetes Objects:**
   - Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Services
   - Creating, updating, and deleting resources with `kubectl`

4. **Hands-On Exercise:**
   - Deploy a simple application in a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., a stateless web app)
   - Expose the application with a Service
   - Scale the application using `kubectl scale`

### Phase 3 Outcome

You should be able to run a basic application on Kubernetes, using core concepts like Pods, Deployments, and Services.

## Phase 4: Kubernetes Deep Dive

**Goal:** Gain proficiency in Kubernetes management and more advanced features.

### Phase 4 Topics

1. **ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Volumes:**
   - Managing configuration with ConfigMaps and Secrets
   - Storing data with Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

2. **Kubernetes Networking:**
   - Cluster networking basics: Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
   - Ingress controllers and Ingress resources for routing

3. **Kubernetes Scheduling and Scaling:**
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
   - Node affinity, taints, and tolerations for advanced scheduling

4. **Kubernetes Security:**
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Network Policies
   - Pod Security Policies (PSP)

5. **Deployments and StatefulSets:**
   - Understanding the difference between Deployments and StatefulSets
   - Deploying stateful applications

6. **Hands-On Exercise:**
   - Deploy a stateful service like a database with StatefulSets
   - Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage application configurations

### Phase 4 Outcome

You should be comfortable managing Kubernetes clusters, including deployments, scaling, networking, and security features.

## Phase 5: Advanced Kubernetes and CI/CD

**Goal:** Master advanced Kubernetes topics and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

### Phase 5 Topics

1. **Kubernetes Operators and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):**
   - What are Operators?
   - Writing and deploying a simple Operator

2. **Monitoring and Logging in Kubernetes:**
   - Set up logging with Fluentd or ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

3. **Kubernetes in Production:**
   - Best practices for Kubernetes in production environments
   - Kubernetes clusters in cloud platforms (AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS)

4. **CI/CD with Docker and Kubernetes:**
   - Automating Docker image builds with Jenkins or GitLab CI
   - Deploying to Kubernetes from CI/CD pipelines
   - Rolling updates and Canary deployments

5. **Hands-On Exercise:**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline to build a Docker image and deploy it to Kubernetes automatically
   - Implement rolling updates

### Phase 5 Outcome

You should have the knowledge and skills to work with Kubernetes in production environments and set up automated deployments.

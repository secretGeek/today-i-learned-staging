# Find view guid

It can be hard to find the guid of a list, if you don't have many permissions (I have very little permissions in this list)

But if you export a list to Excel:

![export_to_excel](export_to_excel.png)

It will embed the guid in the data connection properties

![find_view_guid.png](find_view_guid.png)

Bit convoluted, but there it is.

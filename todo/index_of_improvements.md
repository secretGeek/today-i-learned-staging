## todo tracking


- search for the word "todo" throughout the manuscript and put them on a list that asks if they should be ignored or given more weight.

	all you need to do as the violations pour in -- is rank them by how much importance you give them now and in the next six months.

	the type of governance method i would like to permit -- but i haven't yet got legal permission to employ, is:

		those numbers are used to decide the divvying up of monthly payments to people who participate by completing any of these todos.


- have an attached integra-like system

	- where tokens must be signed if received from the client

		having been distributed readable but signed from the source location who knows the private key by virtue of having used it to create the item it is now receiving back.


- keywords are highlighted.

- keywords are inter-related.

	(many are put in an ignore list.)

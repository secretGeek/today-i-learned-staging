# Wordle for Word Clouds or Tag Clouds: Tips!

There's a lot of word cloud generators, all inspired by "[Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/)" -- the original and still the best, created by [Jonathan Feinberg](http://www.wordle.net/contact). Sadly it requires java to run it properly. If you do get it, here's some tips to get the best out of it:

- To control the size of words you can either repeat the words many times, or end every word with ":3" (or some other number) to indicate it's relative size.
- To treat a phrase with spaces as a single word, replace the spaces with `~` -- the tilde character.
- Common words like "Not" are hidden, by default. To show them, select `Do not hide common words` in the `Language` menu.

# Using notepad as a log/journal

If the first 4 letters of a text file are ".LOG" then when you launch that text file in `notepad`, instead of opening it at the top for reading, opens it at the bottom for appending. And automatically inserts a time and date stamp.

(You may also know that F5 inserts a date/time stamp.)

Tested in 2016, in Windows 10: still works.

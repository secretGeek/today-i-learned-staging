# Remove unreachable recycle bin crap

On a networked (work) computer that has been used by a lot of other users, I was running low on hard drive space.

Running spacesniffer (as admin) I saw that there were 26+ GB of files under `C:\$Recycle.Bin` -- even though I had already emptied the hard drive.

I reasoned that these were things the other users had put in the recycle bin. Or the recycle bin was in some way corrupted.

I don't care why -- I just need lots of space in a hurry to complete a task with a tight deadline.

The solution

from an **elevated** command prompt and then

	rd /s/q c:\$Recycle.Bin

Output:

	C:\>rd /s/q c:\$Recycle.Bin
	The directory is not empty.

	C:\>rd /s/q c:\$Recycle.Bin

(I had to run it twice.)

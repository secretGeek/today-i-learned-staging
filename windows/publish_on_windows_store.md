	- The price shown is a *one-time registration fee and no renewal is required*.

> Per the [Store Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/store-policies#1014-account-type), apps with certain functionality, such as those that access financial account information or that require authentication to access primary functionality (without using a secure dedicated third party authentication provider), can only be published by company accounts.

From the [Store Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/store-policies#1014-account-type)...

> **10.14 Account Type** &mdash; If a reasonable consumer would interpret your publisher account name to be that of a business entity, you must publish from a company account type, not an individual account type

> **10.8.3** &mdash; If your product requires financial account infot

If someone elses product violates your trademarks of copyright, the [process is described here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/trademark-and-copyright-protection)

# Cheatsheet: MacOS Keyboard Shortcuts

How can I get *anything* done on a Mac... here's a minimal cheatsheet to get me started

There's no backspace key... but the "delete" key acts as a backspace key. To perform a "delete" (as we know it in windows) you use `Fn` `Delete`


| Keys | Purpose | Windows Equivalent |
|------|-------------|-----|
| ⌘   | `Command` Key | A modifier, a bit like the `Windows` key. |
| ⌘ `R`  | Refresh browser screen | `F5` |
| `Del` | Delete backwards  | `Backspace` |
| `Fn` `Del` | Delete (forwards not backwards) | `Delete` |
| `Shift` ⌘ `5` | Screenshot | `Print Screen` |
| ⌘ `F` | Find | `Ctrl` `F` |
| ⌘ `G` | Find aGain | `F3` |
| ⌘ `W` | Close tab | `Ctrl` `W` or `Ctrl` `F4` |
| `Ctrl` ⌘ `Q` | Lock the computer | `Win` `L` |
| `Ctrl` `tab` | Switch tab | `Ctrl` `tab` |
| `shift` ⌘ `.` | Show hidden files |  |
| ⌘ `T` | New Tab in Safari | `Ctrl` `T` |
| ⌘ `space` | Activate 'spotlight' | | 
| `Fn` `F11` | Go to desktop | `Win` `D` |
| ⌘ `Z` | Undo | `Ctrl` `Z` |

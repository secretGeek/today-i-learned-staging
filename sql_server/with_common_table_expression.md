# WITH (common table expressions)

Common table expressions are a good way to reuse a piece of SQL.

	;WITH Sales_CTE
	AS
	-- Define the CTE query.
	(
		SELECT SalesPersonID, SalesOrderID, YEAR(OrderDate) AS SalesYear
		FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
		WHERE SalesPersonID IS NOT NULL
	)
	-- Define the outer query referencing the CTE name.
	SELECT SalesPersonID, COUNT(SalesOrderID) AS TotalSales, SalesYear
	FROM Sales_CTE
	GROUP BY SalesYear, SalesPersonID
	ORDER BY SalesPersonID, SalesYear;
	GO

## Bonus points: **recursive** CTEs

The general form is:

	Define a base case.
	UNION ALL
	Define a recursive case.

Example:

	;WITH cte AS
	(
		-- Define a base case
		SELECT CAST('/' + Name AS VARCHAR(50)) as 'CteName', ID
		FROM dbo.YourTable
		WHERE parent_id IS NULL

		-- UNION ALL
		UNION ALL

		-- Define a recursive case
		SELECT CAST(cte.CteName + '/' + Name AS VARCHAR(50)), t.ID
		FROM dbo.YourTable t
		INNER JOIN cte ON t.parent_id = cte.id
	)
	SELECT cteName FROM cte
	ORDER BY ID



## Multiple CTEs

To define multiple....


	;WITH Sales_CTE
	AS
	-- Define the First CTE query.
	(
		SELECT SalesPersonID, SalesOrderID, YEAR(OrderDate) AS SalesYear
		FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
		WHERE SalesPersonID IS NOT NULL
	),
	-- ^ Comma, followed by the Next CTE
	Miles_Driven_CTE AS
	(
		Select SalesPersonID, YEAR(TripDate) as Year, SUM(Distance) as Miles
		FROM Vehicle.Usage
		GROUP BY SalesPersonID, YEAR(TripDate)
	)
	-- Define the outer query referencing ANY/ALL OF the CTE name.
	SELECT
		s.SalesPersonID,
		COUNT(s.SalesOrderID) AS TotalSales,
		m.Miles,
		m.Year
	FROM
		Sales_CTE s
	INNER JOIN
		Miles_Driven_CTE m on s.SalesPersonID = m.SalesPersonID
			AND m.Year = s.SalesYear
	GROUP BY
		m.Year,
		s.SalesPersonID
	ORDER BY
		s.SalesPersonID,
		m.Year desc;
	GO


Note that a CTE *can* refer to any of the preceeding CTEs.

And that we often write a ';' before the 'WITH' so that the compiler is happy. Compilers have inflexible wishes.

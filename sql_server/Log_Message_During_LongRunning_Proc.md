# Log message immediately during a long running procedure

Sometimes you have a long running process, and you want it to emit messages, but you don't want to wait until the end to see those messages.

Then raise them as errors, as follows:

    SET @Message = 'Begin Switcharoo at ' + CAST(GETDATE() AS VARCHAR(50))

    RAISERROR (@Message, 0, 1) WITH NOWAIT

You can even use this form of messaging inside TRY/CATCH statements because:

> TRY/CATCH in SQL will only catch errors with severity > 10, so using RAISERROR in this way won't jump into your CATCH statement.

You cannot use it inside functions, as functions prohibit side effects. (You can't use `print` either)

To preface the message with a date/time down to the millisecond, try this:

        Declare @Message Varchar(255) = (CONVERT(VARCHAR(50), GetDate(), 121) + ': BEGIN switcharoo' )
        RAISERROR (@Message, 0, 1) WITH NOWAIT

Other keywords: synchronous, asynchronous

# Slow and long running queries

Famous query to show which queries are the worst performers.

You may want to change the `Order by`...

You may lack permissions to run this. Specifically:

	VIEW SERVER STATE permission was denied on object 'server', database 'master'.

Which requires this to be executed:

	use master
	go
	GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO <user_name>

...if possible.

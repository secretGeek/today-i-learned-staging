# How much space does my DB use?

These two commands give you some nice summary info about your database:

	sp_helpdb MY_DATABASE_NAME
	go
	sp_spaceused

(...including the names of the .mdf and .ldf files which you'll use for the [Backup restore script](backup_restore_script.md))

To see available space use:

	EXEC master..xp_fixeddrives

# Run a command against each table

While I generally use NimbleText to [run a command against each table](http://nimbletext.com/HowTo/OneQueryManyTables), there are some handy features built into SQL Server that let you do this in a quite seamless manner.

> `sp_msforeachtable`: Runs a command with '?' replaced with each table name (v6.5 and up)

For example:

    exec sp_msforeachtable
        @Command1 = 'print ''reindexing table ?''',
        @Command2 = 'dbcc dbreindex(''?'')',
        @Command3 = 'select count (*), '?' as TableName [?] from ?'

Here's a minimum example to try for yourself:

    exec sp_msforeachtable 'select count (*), '?' as TableName [?] from ?'

You can change the character to use for tablename by supplying a second parameter
    exec sp_MSforeachtable 'print "Should I drop *?"', '*'

Honestly, I wouldn't use this feature at all.

I much prefer the versatility of getting table lists from Information_Schema or even SysObjects, and then turning those results into queries with [NimbleText](http://nimbletext.com/HowTo/OneQueryManyTables).

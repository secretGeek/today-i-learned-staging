# Use Ctrl-E to execute your query

I'm very used to using Ctrl-E to execute my query.

In a recent version of SQL Server Management Studio this key combo was no longer mapped.

To get it mapped again:

![ctrl_e_execute.png](ctrl_e_execute.png)

	Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard | Query.Execute

Go into "Press shortcut keys", hit Ctrl-E and it'll show you that you're overwriting the combo for word wrap or something.

Do it!

SIMILARLY.... Query.ResultsToGrid should be Ctrl-D but is not. So fix that while you're there.

(I'm not even game to check up on Alt-X)

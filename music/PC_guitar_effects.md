# How to use your PC to add effects to the guitar (like pedals)

The software Gnuitar is good for this.

> [Gnuitar: sourceforge.net/projects/gnuitar/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuitar/)

It works on all platforms and is opensource.

## Device

Planning to get an `iRig HD 2` which connects to iPhone, iPad and PC.

On iPhone you can use it with many apps including Garage band and ToneBridge.

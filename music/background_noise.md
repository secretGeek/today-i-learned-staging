# Background noise

When working from home or in a noisy office it can be helpful to have some background noise.

For example [Coffitivity](https://coffitivity.com/) "recreates the ambient sounds of a cafe"

This site -- [noise machines](https://mynoise.net/noiseMachines.php) is extremely thorough.

White noise is particularly helpful to "camouflage the annoyance caused by tinnitus, a ringing in the ear occurring without any stimulus."

These background sounds are also helpful for tuning out the inane chatter and bustle of coworkers or the monotonous drone of your own existential dread.

There is also a specialty background-sounds site for role playing games: [Tabletop audio](https://tabletopaudio.com/), as described here: [Role Playing Games for Kids](http://wiki.secretgeek.net/rpg-for-kids)

Note also that spotify has a headspace playlist. This can be a good way to get into meditation.

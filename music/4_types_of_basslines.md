# There are only 4 types of basslines

I found this video interesting....

**["The Only 4 TYPES Of Bass Lines You'll Ever Need To Create"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlITtBMC8lc)**

**Type 1 monorhythmic chord followers**

* One consistent rhythm through out (1/4 note or 8th note) follows the chords, just plays the root.
* Good for "driving" the band.
* Can be done in a "bouncy" way too.
* Can be hypnotic for lower energy songs.

**Type 2 - drum rhythm chord followers**

* Rhythm follows the drums (particularly the bass) ... the notes chosen still follow the root of the chords.

**Type 3 - mimic**

* Synchronise with the lead instrument - e.g. play the same riff as the guitar or same riff as piano
works for reinforcing and filling out a killer riff, giving a fatter sound.
* Works best when there *is* a killer riff.

**Type 4 - bass solo**

Bass does its own thing. Think flea, les claypool. Bass players whos work stands apart from the rest of the song.

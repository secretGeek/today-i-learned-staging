# Making Expando/Accordian with Plain Html

Here's something that escaped me for far too long.

You can create expand/collapse regions with plain html using the `details` tag (and the `summary` tag)

e.g. this code:


## Text below can expand...

<details>Once expanded, this is the details you will see.</details>



## Text below can expand...

<details>This text can expand</details>

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the details....</summary>
Once expanded, this is the details you will see.
</details>

# UX/Design resources I love


- [Twitter thread "Little UI Details"](https://twitter.com/i/events/880688233641848832?s=13) 

	> "A collections of little tips from `@steveschoger` to improve your visual design skills with the little details that make a big difference 👏"
- [Article explaining the tips seen in the thread above](https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886)
- [Web Design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/)
- [UX Quiz: "Can't Unsee" Trains Your Eyes](https://cantunsee.space/)
- If you *can't* see why one design is "better" than another, then look closer and take your time. Learn to see. Being able to quickly differentiate/identify different things (training your senses) is a big part of building any skill.
- I flicked through "The Non-Designer's Design Book" by Robin Williams in a book store once and my mind exploded. Over and over it demonstrates the value of four things: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity.
- [Little Big Details](https://littlebigdetails.com/) is a blog that highlights tiny moments of UX delight. (I'd rather share a "best of" little big details, as an intro to the topic.)
- Visual Hierarchy
- Color theory

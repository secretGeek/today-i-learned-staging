# Install chocolatey (aka choco)

From `cmd.exe` (with administrative rights)

    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin


Or, from powershell (with administrative rights):

    iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))


After that, [choco commands](commands.md) should work.

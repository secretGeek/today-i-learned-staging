# Bind JSON POST to MVC Action

You already put a `[method: HttpPost]` attribute on the action.

But when you look at the received parameter, it is null.

Hint: try the `[FromBody]` attribute on the parameters.

And ensure the POST is given a `Content-type` of `application/json`

	x.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/json')

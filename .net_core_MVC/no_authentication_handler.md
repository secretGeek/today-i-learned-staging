# Overcoming "No authentication handler is configured to handle the scheme: Identity.Application"


This error:


    InvalidOperationException: No authentication handler is configured to handle the scheme: Identity.Application



For me, it was because in:

    public void Configure


I had simply left out:

    app.UseIdentity();


(Which goes just before `app.UseMvc(routes =>` )

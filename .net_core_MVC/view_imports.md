# View Imports file

Behold the wonders of "_ViewImports.cshtml"

This file is located in the views folder.

It contains such wise utterances as these:

    @using MyProject.Model
    @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

And thus, by adding `@usings` to't, you can avoid the need for peppering your views with more usings.

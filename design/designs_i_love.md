# Designs i love

I worked out that as part of working toward creating your branding/personality feel it's good to keep track of the things that catch your eye and which you love.

You can certainly use a site like pinterest for this (or even pinboard/delicious) -- but since i like to use my `til` files for everything i'll just do that instead.

Several of the pages here:

- <https://officehours.io/>
- <https://officehours.io/pro>
- <http://Everytimezone.com> of course... so beautiful

- I like the heading/body font combo here: [Deep C Diving - Fast and Scalable Text Interfaces at the Bottom](https://cpponsea.uk/2020/sessions/deep-c-diving-fast-and-scalable-text-interfaces-at-the-bottom.html)
- Heading font is called:

		font-family: 'Exo', sans-serif;

included via:

	<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat%7CExo" rel="stylesheet">

- body font is:

		font-family: "Avenir Next", 'Exo', sans-serif;

(It's just that 'Exo' font, Avenir is not loaded.)

# nginx - a web server

nginx overtook apache as the most popular webserver in the world.

what i use it for is as an internet facing webserver that acts as a 'reverse proxy' for my web apps (which themselves run `kestrel`, a lightweight webserver, that isn't robust enough to withstand the open internet)

install via `apt-get`

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nginx

then start the service, if you're interested.

    sudo service nginx start

go and look at the config...

    cd /etc/nginx/
    cat nginx.conf

but the stuff we'll be dealing with mostly is in this folder:

    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/

If you're only going to host one site, then go ahead and edit the file `default`.

But we're not going to do things the easy way: we're going to host multiple sites from this VM. So...

Make a copy of the file, 'default' and in that file tell us how nginx should pass requests onto your account.
e.g.

    sudo cp default yourdomain.com

then edit the file, via `sudo`, ...

    sudo nano yourdomain.com

And update it to something like...

    server {
        listen 80;
        root /opt/websites/yourdomain.com/app;
        server_name blog.yourdomain.com; # this is the incoming path that it will recognise...
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # this is the local path it will defer to...
            # the port number there is the one we're using for it (see hosting.config)
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }

*See [Use nginx to redirect www and non https to bare https](redirect_www_https.md) for a better final example of nginx config with https and redirecting www to bare url)*

Now -- we need to create a symbolic link from your newly added file in the sites-available directory to the sites-enabled directory

    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

to test if your changes are valid...

    sudo nginx -t

Sometimes it says the edits you made were indeed horrible, e.g..

    nginx: [emerg] unexpected "}" in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yourdomain.com:86
    nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed

(I had an extra "}")

And another example:

	$ sudo nginx -t
	nginx: [warn] conflicting server name "codesmackdown.com" on 0.0.0.0:80, ignored
	nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
	nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

(I had two config files that both wanted to be handlers for the `codesmackdown.com` `server_name` ...)

In which case you need to edit the file and fix it. Then `sudo nginx -t` again to see if the changes are now valid.

Another thing is that you might be replacing an old site, served from an old folder/app and old config file with a new site, served from a new folder/app/config file.

In that case you may also have to remove the symbolic link of the old file from the `site-enabled` folder.

Once everything is tickety-boo you'll see:

    $ sudo nginx -t
    nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
    nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

So you can tell nginx to go ahead and use this newly crafted and verified configuration...

    sudo nginx -s reload

## About remote_addr

Note, this particular line of config:

    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

This is so that inside our application we'll be able to see the original IP Address of the client. The original IP request is terminated by `nginx`, and a new request is sent to our application. So if we read the IPAddress a normal way it will simply say 127.0.0.1 (or ::1). Instead if we look at the request header 'X-Real-IP' we will see the original remote IP address of the caller. In C# I do that like this:

    var ipaddress = Request.HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress.ToString();

    if (Request.Headers["X-Real-IP"].Count() > 0)
    {
        ipaddress = Request.Headers["X-Real-IP"];
    }

## Tail nginx log

    sudo tail -n 20 -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

## gzip -- enable it!

I get poor scores at google pagespeed insights: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=secretgeek.net&tab=desktop and at
tools.pingdom -- https://tools.pingdom.com/#!/cpJDXC/secretgeek.net

...partly because I haven't enabled gzip compression.

To enable it i edit the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file and enable the gzip stuff (plus add a little more types to compress)

Here's what I end up with:

	##
	# Gzip Settings
	##

	gzip on;
	gzip_disable "msie6";

	gzip_vary on;
	gzip_proxied any;
	gzip_comp_level 6;
	gzip_buffers 16 8k;
	gzip_http_version 1.1;
	gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript application/vnd.ms-fontobject application/x-font-ttf font/opentype image/svg+xml image/x-icon;
	gzip_min_length 256;

THen I check the conf file using good old:

	sudo nginx -t

And reload the nginx service with good old:

	sudo nginx -s reload

I re-run the pagespeed test and my scores are up by 3 points.

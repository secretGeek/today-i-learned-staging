# ufw: Uncomplicated Firewall... how do we set that up?

Just before (or immediately after) you've got nginx installed, it's time to think about getting a firewall in place.

`ufw` (Ucomplicated FireWall) is just the ticket.

Enable `ufw`, and allow these ports

 - 80, for inbound http requests, 
 - and 22 for SSH, as follows:

		sudo ufw enable;sudo ufw allow 22/tcp;sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

To check if `ufw` is set up as expected...

	sudo ufw status

And you should see this result:

	Status: active

	To                         Action      From
	--                         ------      ----
	22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
	80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
	22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
	80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

For extra info you can try:

	sudo ufw status verbose

Result:

	Status: active
	Logging: on (low)
	Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
	New profiles: skip

	To                         Action      From
	--                         ------      ----
	22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
	80/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
	22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
	80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)

And to see which apps are registered with ufw...

	sudo ufw app list

result:

	Available applications:
		Nginx Full
		Nginx HTTP
		Nginx HTTPS
		OpenSSH

## Considerations for later...

> HTTPS connections can be allowed with this command:
>
>     sudo ufw allow https
>
> If you'd rather use the port number, 443, use this command:
>
>   sudo ufw allow 443

Simpler one is:

	sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'

Or, for http and https:

	sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

You can remove those you've already allowed with, for example:

	sudo ufw delete allow 80/tcp

...because that's superceded by 'Nginx HTTP' profile

	sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'

...because that's superceded by 'Nginx Full' (which allow both `http` and `https`)

Might also want to allow 'OpenSSH' something like `sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH'` but i'm not sure so I'd stick with

	sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

For now.

Although, checking what application lists are avaible with:

	sudo ufw app list

I see:

	Nginx Full
	Nginx HTTP
	Nginx HTTPS
	OpenSSH

So I expect if i do `sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH'` then i would be able to delete 22/tcp and still use ssh.

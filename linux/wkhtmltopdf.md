# wkhtmltopdf on ubuntu headless

Install `wkhtmltopdf` with

	sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf

Then try to run it, as per the example at <http://wkhtmltopdf.org>

    wkhtmltopdf http://google.com google.pdf

Receive this error:

    QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display
    Aborted (core dumped)

Or -- as happened on a different day on a different machine, with a problem that had the exact same solution -- I got this error:

	$ wkhtmltopdf http://google.com google.pdf

	wkhtmltopdf: cannot connect to X server

The problem in both cases is that there's no desktop environment, no display, no X server.

The solution, according to <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/192642/wkhtmltopdf-qxcbconnection-could-not-connect-to-display>

> Just install xvfb from apt and then, you can run:

    xvfb-run wkhtmltopdf

i.e., just put xvfb-run before any wkhtmltopdf command.)

Okay so I ran:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install xvfb

Then the command worked:

    $ xvfb-run wkhtmltopdf http://google.com google.pdf
    Loading page (1/2)
	Printing pages (2/2)
	Done

(meanwhile i have a similar blocking issue with wkhtmltopdf on windows... it hangs the process... but do not yet have a solution.)

# How much memory is free?

A common way...

    $ top


Also

    $ free -m
                  total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:            488         228          23          11         236         217
    Swap:             0           0           0

The figure under "available" is how much is "Free and available"

i.e. what humans usually mean when they say "free"


To watch it as it changes...

    $ watch -n 5 free -m

This will refresh every 5 seconds.


Another techinique:

    $ cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemAvailable

    MemAvailable:     223336 kB

And similarly:

    $ watch -n 5 'cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemAvailable'

To see a lot of specific info about your machine...

    $ sudo lshw

# chmod - and the magic of file permissions

## allow everything

	$ chmod 777 /opt/webapps

Causes these permissions:

	drwxrwxrwx

How is this true? What does this mean?

	777 -- three digits, each digit is the value of 3 flags, 3 bits.

- `7`, in binary, is `111`.

Each digit refers to three different groups:

This

	drwxrwxrwx

...can be broken out into 4 categories:

	d  rwx   rwx   rwx

Concentrate on those last three, the repeated 'rwx's...

	 +---------------  Permissions of the owner of the file,
	 |     +---------  The group associated with the file, and
	 |     |     +---  Everybody else.
	 |     |     |
	rwx   rwx   rwx
	|||   |||   |||
	|||   |||   ||+-- execute permission for everybody else
	|||   |||   |+--- write permission for everybody else
	|||   |||   +---- read permission for everybody else
	|||   |||
	|||   ||+-- execute permission for the group associated with the file
	|||   |+--- write permission for the group associated with the file
	|||   +---- read permission for the group associated with the file
	|||
	||+-- execute permission for the owner of the file
	|+--- write permission for the owner of the file
	+---- read permission for the owner of the file

- `r` = read permission
- `w` = write permission
- `x` = execute permission

If a permission was missing it would be represented by a dash '-'.

## similarly

- `chmod` - modify permissions
- `chown` - change the owner of the file
- `chgrp` - change the group

## Common patterns

### owner can read write but not execute, no one else can read write:

	sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_dsa

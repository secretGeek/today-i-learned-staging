# Count all files in a directory, recursively

## Count files in current folder, not recursive:

	ls -1 | wc -l

## Count files only:

	find . -type f | wc -l

## Count files and directories:

	find . | wc -l

## Count directories only:

	find . -type d | wc -l

## Now look at this:

	~/.nuget$ find . -type f | wc -l
	5259
	~/.nuget$ find . | wc -l
	10182

The .nuget folder has 5259 files. Even worse... it has almost as many directories as folders!

# Developing .net core app and deploying to linux at digital ocean

## Materials you will need

- your own domain name already purchased. (suggest <http://gandi.net> as registrar)
- $5 per month to pay digital ocean
- need a local machine on which you will do your development. (i'll assume local machine is windows though it could easily be osx or linux)

With any articles mentioned below: be sure to read the comments. Sometimes they highlight common problems that people have, or shortcomings/errors in the article that haven't been corrected yet.

## Prepare your digital ocean account

1. sign up at digital ocean.
2. use PuTTYgen to create SSH keypair
3. tell digital ocean about your public key.

## Create and configure your droplet

- Create a droplet at digital ocean. Must be 64 bit (.net core does not run in 32 bit linux). Would currently be Ubuntu 16.
  - tell it to use the SSH key you already provided it with.
- use PuTTY to connect to your droplet as root
  - create a new user
  - give that user sudo privileges
  - test that the new user can connect through SSH.
  - test that the new user can use sudo privileges.
  - stop the root user from being able to connect.
  - install and configure fail2ban
  - customize your bash profile (totally unnecessary, but fun!!)
  - install .net core on your droplet
  - build a helloworld console app
  - test your helloworld console app
  - install sftp
  - create /opt/websites/ -- this is the folder where you will upload your web applications
  - create a new user who will have limited privileges such as uploading files.
  - give the new user permissions to read and write the /opt/websites/ area.

## Prepare to publish to droplet (on your machine)

- use filezilla to connect to your droplet, as your file uploading user.
- verify that you can download/upload files
- create a new .net core app
- customize its port number. (this will be handy if you want to host more than 1 app in your droplet)
- publish it using `dotnet publish` (from the folder that contains the `project.json` file. The published content will end up in the `bin\Debug\netcoreapp1.0\publish\` subfolder)
- upload the published content to your droplet

## Test via cli (on your droplet)

- install nginx
- configure nginx to act as a reverse proxy to your site
- run your site in a console. (dotnet `yoursite.dll`)

## Tell via ip address (from a browser)

- visit your ipaddress... see that the site is returned
- configure nameservers at your domain name registrar
- setup domain records at digital ocean (a record, cname)

## Make site reliable (on your droplet)

- configure nginx to expect the domain name
- install supervisor
- configure supervisor to keep your app running

## Website monitoring

- use pingdom or "statuscake" to monitor your site(s).

## Here was my preliminary list

### STEP ONE: THE MUST-HAVES

- Review the [Ubuntu 14.04 server checklist](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/new-ubuntu-14-04-server-checklist) which covers:
  - [Initial Ubuntu server setup](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04) tutorial with step-by-step configuration instructions, and
  - Connecting to your Droplet with [SSH](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-connect-to-your-droplet-with-ssh).
- Use DigitalOcean's DNS to [set up your hostname](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean) from the Control Panel.
- Protect your servers by reviewing these [7 security measures](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/7-security-measures-to-protect-your-servers).
- Keep your data safe with an effective [backup strategy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-choose-an-effective-backup-strategy-for-your-vps).

### STEP TWO: WEB SERVERS

- [Install the powerful Nginx](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts) web server on Ubuntu
- [Use Nginx virtual hosts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts) to serve multiple sites on one server.

### EXTRA CREDIT: SECURE FILE TRANSFER

- Securely transfer files to your server and between droplets [using SFTP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sftp-to-securely-transfer-files-with-a-remote-server).

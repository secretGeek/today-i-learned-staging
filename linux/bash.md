for "help" on any command:

    ls --help

Or, to review the manual...

    man ls

use up arrow to cycle through previous commands (same as dos)

use Ctrl C (displayed as ^C) to break the current activity.  (same as dos)

    echo hello | xclip -selection c   ...pipe to the clipboard (sort of)

## Bash extra Notes

clear: (same as cls) clears the screen, well....

Note it doesn't really clear the screen as you scroll up and the text is still there.
this command however *does* reset the terminal: printf "\033c"

(when I get profiles working i'll define an alias for `cls`, like this: `alias cls='printf "\033c"'`)

Clipboard -- the short answer is "gfys"

    alias clipo="xclip -selection c"
    alias pasto="xclip -selection clipboard -o"

Files in linux are case senstive, furthermore, they generally don't have file extensions (.txt, .pdf etc). so ~/etc/profile is a file not a folder.

Dot files (files beginning with a ".") are "hidden". (Hidden is not so much a security concept as a convenience feature... they're just tucked away) To view **a**ll files (including hidden) use `ls -a`

To go to your home folder, use simply:

    cd

(That and `ls` are the only two things I remember from using Unix at university. Oh and pine.)

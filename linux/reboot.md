# Reboot linux

## TL/DR:

	$ sudo reboot

## Story

When sshing onto my fave droplet (at digital ocean)...

```plaintext
27 packages can be updated.
14 updates are security updates.

*** System restart required ***
```

SOME people say...

	sudo shutdown -r now

That ^^ is *allegedly* the preferred method, over the more obvious:

	sudo reboot

> Many Unix systems have reboot perform an *instant* reboot &mdash; no syncing, no umounting, nothing. It's just like hitting the reset button

Though someone counters with....

> Judging from the manual pages of both reboot and shutdown, it looks like shutdown provides a bit more lower-level functionality, and reboot is a higher-level tool that uses shutdown.

So I use:

	sudo reboot

After a reboot I found I had to restart some of my systems.

To restart supervisor manually I previously needed to use:

	service supervisor start

But I now have my machines configured to restart the `supervisor` service automatically as described in [cron](cron.md)

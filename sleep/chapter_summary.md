## Criticisms of "Why We Sleep"

There was a rather hard-hitting criticism of the book, by Alexey Guzey:

* [Matthew Walker's "Why We Sleep" Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/)

...and a later response to criticisms from Dr Walker here:

* [Why We Sleep: Responses to questions from readers](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/2019/12/19/why-we-sleep-responses-to-questions-from-readers/)

Personally I don't think those initial criticisms do nearly as much as Alexey thinks they do to destroy the entire validity of the work. They're more like editor's notes, fixing a bug here and there. I'll continue to take the work of a professional sleep researcher over an amateur like Alexey who writes:

> I've been experimenting with sleep for the last month and I converged on a formula of sleeping 4-5 hours per night and then doing as many 20-30 minute naps as I need during the day (1-2 usually).

...and:

> I hope to write the synthesis of everything I know about healthy and efficient sleep habits in the future.

I'll be looking forward to *that.*

It is important to know that "Why We Sleep" is not a guide to helping you get better sleep. It gives you so much information about sleep that it can create or exacerbate anxiety, particularly for people who already have sleep-related problems. This is a major issue and thankfully Dr Walker will be putting a note to that effect on the next edition.

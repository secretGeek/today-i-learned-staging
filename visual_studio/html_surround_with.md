The poor person's "surround with", when you don't have web essentials.

1. Select your text
2. Press Ctrl-X to cut it to clipboard
3. Type your <strong> tag, which Visual Studio will automatically close with your cursor remaining in the middle of the start and end tag
4. Press Ctrl-V to re-insert your text between the tags

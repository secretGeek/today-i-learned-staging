# Places to get ebooks

Apart from your local library (for example [Brisbane City Council free ebooks and audiobooks](ebooks_and_audiobooks.md)), here are some useful sites:

 * [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) -- the same guy that invented the movable type printing press also made this website for distributing books that are out of copyright, I guess.
 * [Standard EBooks](https://standardebooks.org) -- beautifully formatted free ebooks.
 * [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) -- part of the Internet Archive. (which is great!)
 * [Google ebook store](https://play.google.com/store/books/collection/topselling_free) - access to the topselling free ebooks


There is a system called Library Genesis or LibGen, currently available at https://libgen.is/ which allows you to find ebooks. It's similar to sci-hub.


Free audio books at:

* <http://www.openculture.com/freeaudiobooks>
* [librivox](https://librivox.org) 
* <https://audiobookreviews.com>

And:

> On iOS, for those of us addicted to convenience, the Oldio app provides free Audible-style listening to Librivo

* ["Non-resident" library cards](https://weightywords.net/best-non-resident-library-cards-for-overdrive-access/) - as a way to get access in overdrive to more collections.

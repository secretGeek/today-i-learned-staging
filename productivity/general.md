# General parts of a productivity system

* usable from desktop
* usable from mobile
* usable from multiple desktops
* preferably works on desktop when offline
* preferably works on mobile when offline
* data survives long term - outlasts the system
* minimal effort required to capture tasks
* should be long term usable - not just a burst of initial use
* shouldn't overwhelm you once you've been using it for (say) 5 years
* shouldn't be overhwhelming if you step away for (say) a year, and then return



Lots of different needs overlap in a productivity system:

* calendar items
* notes/records (for this i use TIL)
* journal (for this I use a digital journal)
* projects
* TODOs
* prioritizing
* team management
* recurring items
* deadlines
* customer relationship
* shopping lists
* sharing some lists with other people
* kanban / visible card / limits
* things to remember (memorization)


I currently use a mix of things:

* CleverDeck to memorize things
* TIL for things I need to know but not memorize (that are public)
* KV for snippets I need to re-use (not well shared across machines though)
* Password manager for passwords and the like
* Journal file for working memory with "today" command to bring in current calculated daily items
* "markjump" manages links to the folder of each project I'm working on (aliased to `m` and `j` and `um`)
* `.ok` files manage commands relevant to each project, e.g. opening a relevant todo.txt file (or azure devops etc, as the case may be, on a project by project basis)
* "Pocket" for things to read later (automatically synced to Kobo)
* "util" repo for keeping scripts/tools/profile, & TIL itself, synced across machines via a private github repo
* dropbox
* Apple calendar shared for family
* Work calendar is outlook (read with powershell and with daybar)
* Things I find interesting are written in [wiki.secretgeek.net](https://wiki.secretGeek.net)
* Contacts (scattered)
* Birthdays (mostly in FB, some in my head, some just take me by surprise)
* Plan file - collapsible plain text with .html extension, for capturing long term plans/ideas/notes on any project. single file.

The most fundamental concepts of productivity are

* managing your commitments (avoid being overcommitted, know when to say no)
* prioritization (this over that, only needed for things near the top, i.e. stack-rank the head)
* capture of ideas/resources
* habits (good habits, bad habits)

# Have a utils repo

I have a `utils` repo and you should too.

It is a private repository that I clone onto any machine I use.

It is on the [PATH](../powershell/PATH.md) of the machine, so its contents are always available.

Why must it be a private repo? Because I don't have permission to redistribute all of the files.

(Private repos are **free** at [github](https://github.com) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org))

In the utils repo I keep:

 1. All the "[little tools](list_of_tools.md)" I expect to be available and in the PATH on each machine
 2. My powershell profile and powershell scripts
 3. Handy LinqPad scripts
 3. My 'Today I learned' notes -- it's where they are originally written, in a folder called `TIL`.
    (I also have a git repo which grabs that TIL folder, and publishes it as a gitbook at http://TIL.secretGeek.net)

## Capturing animated gifs

Two super simple apps for this, LICEcap and gifcam.  Gifcam (from <http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/>) lets you edit/remove frames.

SpaceSniffer is my current go to tool for working out where all your hard drive space went. Previously used SpaceMonger, and at one time used SequoiaView.

I noticed recently that the industry favorite WinDirStat also includes a squarified treemap.

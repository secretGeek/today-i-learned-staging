# PIP: Pip installs Packages

Pip is a package manager that comes bundled with Python (since version 2.7.9, and since 3.4)

You can use it to install things:

e.g.

    pip install grip

Here's a very easy to follow guide to [using pip on windows](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/using-pip-on-windows)

## Making pip available (for visual studio users)

What I found in my case is that I didn't have `pip` available on my `path`, nor `python` for that matter. 

But when I searched my program files, I found *several* versions of python under: 

	C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\

...then added the best one to my `path`, and it's sub directory `scripts` i also added to my `path` (as `pip` is in the `scripts` subfolder of python.)

Here are two folders I added in this case:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_86;
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_86\Scripts;


## Elevated console

I found that installing things with `pip` often requires an elevated shell.


## Upgrading pip

Sometimes you see a message like this

	WARNING: You are using pip version 19.2.3, however version 20.1 is available.
	You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.

So here is the upgrade command... again, need an `elevated` shell

	python -m pip install --upgrade pip

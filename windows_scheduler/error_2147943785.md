# Task Scheduler Fails with Error 2147943785

If a Task in Windows Task Scheduler fails to launch and logs an event with:

	Task Category "Task Started Failed"
	Operational code "Launch Failure"
	Additional data "Error Value: 2147943785"

What does this mean? It means:

	---------------------------
	Task Scheduler
	---------------------------
	This task requires that the user account specified has Log on as batch job rights. For more information about setting this policy, see the Task Security Context topic in Help.
	---------------------------
	OK
	---------------------------

The task is configured to run as a user that doesn't have the necessary permissions, specifically "Log on as batch job rights"

# Bower init

When running a `bower` command (ok, if you must know it was....

	bower install markdown-it --save

)...

the final part of the output said:

	bower    no-json No bower.json file to save to, use bower init to create one

So...

Creating a `bower.json` file with `bower init` is very fun, and reminiscent of `npm init`

After going through the questionnaire I ended up with something like this:

	{
		"name": "A great name",
		"authors": [
			"secretGeek <leon....@gmail.com>"
		],
		"description": "a messy thing",
		"main": "index.html",
		"keywords": [
			"markdown"
		],
		"license": "MIT",
		"homepage": "",
		"private": true,
		"ignore": [
			"**/.*",
			"node_modules",
			"bower_components",
			"test",
			"tests"
		],
		"dependencies": {
			"markdown-it": "^8.2.2"
		}
	}


Note it was smart enough to add what i'd added already as a dependency.

	var MarkdownIt = require('markdown-it'),
			md = new MarkdownIt();
	var result = md.render('# markdown-it rulezz!');

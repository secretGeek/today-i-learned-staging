# Reduce flickering on custom invalidate/paint

Say we are doing custom painting on a panel, and we want to reduce flickering as much as possible.
There's a few ways to do it, but this is the greatest...

Let's say your panel is called `this.splitContainerMain.Panel2`, then do this in your form constructor...

	typeof(Panel).InvokeMember("DoubleBuffered",
	BindingFlags.SetProperty | BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic,
	null, this.splitContainerMain.Panel2, new object[] { true });

Background info on how this sort of thing is done...

In a method, such as RefreshPanel() (which is also called very early in form's life)

	var bitMap = new Bitmap(splitContainerMain.Panel2.Width, splitContainerMain.Panel2.Height);

	using (var g = Graphics.FromImage(bitMap)) {
		//Do your custom drawing... something more inspired than this hopefully
		g.DrawRectangle(System.Drawing.Pens.Black, 10, 10, 10, 10);
	}

	//This causes the repaint!
	this.splitContainerMain.Panel2.Invalidate();

And then, in the paint method, just render the bitmap.

	private void splitContainer1_Panel2_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e)
	{
		if (bitMap == null) return;
		e.Graphics.DrawImage(bitMap, new Point(0, 0));
	}

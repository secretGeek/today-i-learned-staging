# Links containing parens, in Markdown

I'm writing [Your First Product](http://YourFirstProduct.com) (the book, not the website) in markdown. (Okay - the site is mostly written in markdown too, but I digress)... there was a url that ends with a closing parenthesis.

The markdown parser in gitbook did not understand this (although the one in pandoc did). To make it work everywhere I had to encode the parens as `%28` and `%29` respectively.

So:

    '[reciprocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology))'

...linked to:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology

...and displayed as:

    'reciprocity)'


Whereas:

    '[reciprocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28social_psychology%29)'

...worked correctly *and* displayed correctly.

Compare '[reciprocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology))' to '[reciprocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28social_psychology%29)' to see if the current toolchain for TIL is working ok. (It is, thanks [clowncar](https://github.com/secretGeek/clowncar) and markdig.)

*Test it [here without encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)) and [here with encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28social_psychology%29)*


**Lesson:** consider encoding `(` and `)` as `%28` and `%29` in urls.

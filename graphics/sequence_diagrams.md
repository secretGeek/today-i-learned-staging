I've installed PlantUML. The docs for it are here:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml

I created this file:

	@startuml
	Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
	Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

	Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
	Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
	@enduml

And then used Alt-D to preview the current file.
(This relied on having restarted VS Code after installing the PlantUML extension.

Looks like you can style the diagrams with a wsd file (which stands for 'websequencediagram':

	@startuml
		!include ../includes/defines.wsd
		!include ../includes/myStyles.wsd
		'contents goes here...
	@enduml
	Now, you can just replace them with a placehold 'autoinclude,

	@startuml
		'autoinclude
		'contents goes here...
	@enduml

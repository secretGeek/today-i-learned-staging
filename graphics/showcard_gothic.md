# Get Showcard Gothic

Wondering why I don't have showcard gothic on my laptop I found it's because it comes with MS Office, which is not on my laptop.

So I downloaded it from [fontzone: showcard-gothic](http://fontzone.net/download/showcard-gothic) and installed it (TTF file)

And now my MS Paint explanations can have the correct font:

Note: I first [checked the file at Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/80cd2486979c2c18f9dd59277c0fd800959afa1ce23820dcf7bce31f208647af/analysis/1487741390/).

# Paint.Net Layers

There's only one secret to mastering Paint.Net.

Put everything in a separate layer.

For example:

- Every part of a drawing/diagram should have its own layer.
- Before applying an effect to a layer -- clone the layer, and hide the original.

Get very comfortable with all the layer related features:

- New layer
- Clone layer
- Delete layer
- Move Layer Up
- Move Layer Down
- Edit the transparency of a layer
- Switch a layer on/off
- Paste in to new layer

Save the file as a .pdn file, and export copies as .png.

# Create a custom search provider in chrome


I would like to create my own custom search provider that:

	- knows that localhost addresses are not a search
	- lets you run javascript commands, perhaps by starting with a special character like "`" or "/"
		i.e. "slash commands"
	- urls just get opened
	- sends regular searches to your regular search provider

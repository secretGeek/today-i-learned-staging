# Chrome before flight

@JakeGinnivan says: Just found out about chrome://flags/#show-saved-copy - *really* useful to turn on before flights!

Help details:

> When a page fails to load, if a stale copy of the page exists in the browser cache, a button will be presented to allow the user to load that stale copy. The primary enabling choice puts the button in the most salient position on the error page; the secondary enabling choice puts it secondary to the reload button

Note that this change will take effect the next time you relaunch Google Chrome.

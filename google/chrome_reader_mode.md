# Chrome reader mode: 'Distill page'

When reading a hard-to-read-due-to-formatting webpage on my iPhone I hit a little icon, called 'reader mode' that makes it all magically readable.

You can achieve reader mode on Chrome as well, if you enable the feature.

Edit the shortcut you use to launch chrome and append this parameter to the `Target`

    --enable-dom-distiller

Restart chrome and then you'll find a 'Distill page' option in the settings menu.

I find that zooming is also helpful, even with the new reading glasses.

The feature is not particularly well implemented, and not widely used. Since maintaining it and improving will require a lot of work, I expect it to quietly die a death of a thousand bugs over the next few years. But we'll see.

# Node Package Manager -- some notes for beginners

**TL/DR** - start with `npm init` to create a `packages.json` file

You are in a folder, doing some things. You suddenly decided you want to install an existing package. I'll choose `lodash` because it's the most popular package, the closest thing to a common library.

	npm install lodash

...it does a bunch of stuff...

and then spits out these warnings:

```plaintext
npm WARN ENOENT ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\Leon\npm_examples\hello1\package.json'
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No description
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No repository field.
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No README data
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No license field.
```

They are just warnings -- so it did go ahead and install the package.

`ENOENT`, by the way, means "Error No Entry"

Here's what's been created, in terms of folders...

```plaintext
hello1
+---node_modules
	+---lodash
		+---fp
		+---internal
```

And there's 520 files!

But back to those warnings:

```plaintext
npm WARN ENOENT ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\Leon\npm_example\hello1\package.json'
```

There's no package.json file...

And the next four warnings:

```plaintext
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No description
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No repository field.
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No README data
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No license field.
```

All say "There's a bunch of missing attributes in the file that's missing."

So what? Why do we need these attributes? And why do we need a package.json file?

First -- let's create a `package.json` file and see if that helps at all.

I add an empty file called `package.json` and I now get these additional warnings:

```plaintext
npm WARN EJSONPARSE Failed to parse json
npm WARN EJSONPARSE No data, empty input at 1:1
npm WARN EJSONPARSE
npm WARN EJSONPARSE ^
```

Okay okay. I update the file Package.json to contain simply: `{}`

Now when I try `npm install lodash` I only get these 3 warnings:

```plaintext
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No description
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No repository field.
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No license field.
```

It makes sense that the warning about "no such file or directory, open '...\package.json' is gone.

But why is the warning about

```plaintext
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No README data
```

...also gone?

npm is saying... well you're making an effort. But really npm? So far we're *not* making an effort. We haven't provided any README data. We've just provided an empty package object. So the 'No README data' error should've stayed. But I digress.

On to the remaining warnings: what are they all about?

```plaintext
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No description
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No repository field.
npm WARN EPACKAGEJSON hello1 No license field.
```

This is essentially npm saying:

> I see you're doing some npm related stuff in the current folder... well, you better not think about publishing your current folder as a package. It's looking mighty shoddy. There's no description. No repository field. No license field. Allow me to summarize: as a package, your current folder STINKS!

Why would `npm` be telling us that? It's as if you walk into a bar, in search of a drink, and the bartender says "You're a shitty employee, we don't hire drunks!" But you don't want to work there, you're there to get a drink! What kind of a crazy judgemental bartender is this `npm` guy?

So, what we have to do is either populate our `package.json` file with a description, with repository details and with license details. (I'll show you how to do that in a moment). Or we can update our `package.json` file to say:

	{ "private":"true" }

That means:

> "This folder is just a private piece of code... I'm NOT planning to publish it to the world, so get the HELL OFF MY CASE, npm, you intrusive, weird, bully."

Now &mdash; what if the current package is not intended only for private use. Then we need to know how to populate the missing attributes.

Here's an example of starting `package.json` that contains just the attributes that are causing warnings:

	{
		"description": "a simple example",
		"repository": {
			"type": "git",
			"url": "git+ssh://git@github.com/secretgeek/example2.git"
		},
		"license": "MIT"
	}

But there's a much neater trick for populating our `package.json`. We can use the command:

	npm init

This will run through a quick tutorial that builds a `package.json` for us.

```plaintext
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
name: (hello1) [and the Cursor is here, awaiting your import]
```

You will end up with something like this:

	{
		"name": "example",
		"version": "1.0.0",
		"description": "a simple example",
		"main": "index.js",
		"scripts": {
			"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
		},
		"repository": {
			"type": "git",
			"url": "git+ssh://git@github.com/secretgeek/example2.git"
		},
		"keywords": [
			"infinity"
		],
		"author": "leon bambrick",
		"license": "MIT",
		"bugs": {
			"url": "https://github.com/secretgeek/example2/issues"
		},
		"homepage": "https://github.com/secretgeek/example2#readme"
	}
